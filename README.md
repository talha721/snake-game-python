# Snake Game

Small Python project intended to implement the classic Snake game.

Note: Current `main.py` in this repository only contains a simple placeholder (`print("Hello")`). If you already have a full game implementation, replace or expand `main.py` accordingly. This README provides guidance for a typical Python/pygame-based Snake game and minimal instructions to run the current placeholder script.

## Features (intended)

- Player-controlled snake that grows when eating food
- Score tracking and increasing difficulty
- Collisions with walls or the snake's own body ends the game
- Keyboard controls for movement

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or newer (3.10+ recommended)

Optional (if the game uses Pygame):

- pygame (for graphics and input handling)

## Installation

1. Clone or copy this repository to your machine.

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate  # on Windows with bash.exe
# or: source .venv/bin/activate  # on Unix-like shells
```

3. Install dependencies (only if you plan to use pygame or other libraries):

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install pygame
```

If you provide a `requirements.txt` later, install with:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

To run the current placeholder script:

```bash
python main.py
```

If you implement the full game using pygame, running the game will usually be the same command:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Controls (typical for Snake)

- Arrow keys or WASD to move the snake
- ESC or close window to quit

## Development notes / How to extend

- Replace the placeholder logic in `main.py` with your game loop using `pygame` (or another library).
- Structure suggestion:
  - `main.py` — entry point (initialization + game loop)
  - `game/` — game logic (snake, food, board)
  - `assets/` — optional images/sounds

A minimal Pygame game loop looks like:

```python
import pygame
# init, create window, game loop, handle events, update, draw
```

## Troubleshooting

- If you see import errors for `pygame`, ensure it's installed in the active Python environment.
- If the window does not open, check that you are not running the script over SSH without X forwarding.

## Assumptions

- I assumed this is a Python project and that a future/typical implementation will use `pygame` for the UI. The current `main.py` is a placeholder that prints "Hello"; if your project already uses a framework, update the README to reflect that.

## Next steps (suggested)

- Implement full game logic or add existing game files.
- Add `requirements.txt` with pinned dependency versions (e.g., `pygame==2.1.3`).
- Add basic unit tests and a simple CI workflow to run them.
